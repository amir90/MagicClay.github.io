<!-- The recent developments in neural fields have brought phenomenal capabilities to the field of shape generation, but they lack crucial properties,
such as incremental control — a fundamental requirement for artistic work.
Triangular meshes, on the other hand, are the representation of choice for
most geometry related tasks, offering efficiency and intuitive control, but do
not lend themselves to neural optimization. To support downstream tasks,
previous art typically proposes a two-step approach, where first a shape is
generated using neural fields, and then a mesh is extracted for further processing. Instead, in this paper we introduce a hybrid approach that maintains
both a mesh and a Signed Distance Field (SDF) representations consistently.
Using this representation, we introduce MagicClay — an artist friendly tool
for sculpting regions of a mesh according to textual prompts while keeping
other regions untouched
